# System Design Documentation

This document outlines the system design for the AI agent system, focusing on the file structure and the design of the `iterate.py` script as part of Step 2 in the project plan.

## File Structure

The project will have a structured Markdown file system to store results, documentation, and iteration data. The proposed structure is as follows:

- `/iterations`: This directory will contain subdirectories for each iteration of the system. Each subdirectory will be named after the iteration number (e.g., `iteration_1`, `iteration_2`, etc.) and will contain the results and data specific to that iteration.
- `/docs`: This directory will contain all documentation related to the system, including this system design document.
- `/src`: This directory will house the Python code, including the `iterate.py` script and any other modules developed for the system.

## Design of the `iterate.py` Script

The `iterate.py` script will be the core component of the system, responsible for executing new iterations and improving the solution based on previous results. The outline of the script's functionality includes:

1. **Initialization**: The script will start by checking the current iteration number and preparing the environment for a new iteration.
2. **Execution of AI Operations**: Utilizing `langchain`, the script will perform the necessary AI operations to generate results for the current iteration.
3. **Analysis of Previous Results**: Before concluding the iteration, the script will analyze the results of the previous iterations to identify areas for improvement.
4. **Self-Improvement**: Based on the analysis, the script will make adjustments to its own operation or suggest changes to the system to enhance future iterations.
5. **Documentation**: Finally, the script will document the results of the current iteration in the `/iterations` directory, following the structured file system.

This design will ensure that the system is iterative, self-aware, reflective, and capable of self-improvement, in line with the project's goals.
